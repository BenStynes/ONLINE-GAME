(a) One method of reducing bandwidth use is to compress the data being transmitted. Let A = {a/20, b/15, c/5, d/15, e/45} be the alphabet and its frequency distribution. Compute the optimal coding for each character. What is the average number of bits/symbol of the codes?

A = 10 B = 1111 C = 1110 D = 110 E = 0

Average = A(2) + b(4) + c(4) + d(3) + e(1) = 14/5 = 2.8

(b) Briefly explain how delta compression works and give an application as example where delta compression is used.



(c) One method of reducing bandwidth use is to compress the data being transmitted. Use the LZW algorithm to compress the string: BABAABAAA. Note that Uppercase A has ASCII value 65 in decimal. Draw diagrams to aid your explanation if appropriate.
