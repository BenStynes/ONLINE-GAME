(a) Can latency be eliminated completely? Explain why.

No due to a lot of reasons , mainky being the time of transfer of data no matter what there whill always be some latency with that, and the time requoired to push packets , communication link speed,
queing at routers or desitaination nodes.

(b) Use an example (shooting round corners/fire-proof problem, etc.) to  illustrate how latency is related to consistency? Use diagrams if appropriate.                        

in an fps if a player has high latency to them it may appear they got shot from nowhere while on the other players screen they shot them before they went around the corner , if  the player shooting had low latency then they would miss every hit usually if the opponent had high latency.
two players with similar levels will barelt experience that.

(c) There are two categories of techniques for consistency management: optimistic and conservative. Which category do the following techniques belong to: dumb client and client-side prediction. Describe the dumb client and client-side prediction.

dumb client: conservative 

client side predicition: optomisitic 

dumb client: client sends input to server , server caculates state, sends to client, client renders state from server

client side prediction: sends out inputs to the server  applies them localy instantly in order to update state, server can override player if simulation has a constraint player doesnt know about, when recive the update from server check if it is different from local if so correct your local.
