(a) What are the advantages and disadvantages of the client/server and peer to peer multiplayer game architectures?  

Advantahes of client server is that it gives the game publisher more control over the server and autehthication and updates are easier to rollout, the networking
code is simpler to right most of the the time and can be seperatly updated without effecting the game.

disadvantages include servers having to be physically operated and mantained, they do not scale as such you must have the player amount predetermined. Limiting service avalibilty.

p2p  advantahes of it are its cheaper and no need for a server, scales well up to a point in terms of badwitch, good data distribution so user created content syncs better
stability it usually has better stability than a server wjere if one thing goes wrong it all goes wrong,

disadvantages include it being hard to implement . harder to prevenet any form of cheating, also security then is also harder to achieve , a cloents connection can influence the game for others
port forwarding may be required. 

(b) In the peer-to-peer network architecture with authoritative host, how the peers communicate with each other? Draw diagrams to aid your explanation if appropriate.        

host 1 is the autoritative host , host 2 connects to 1 , host 3 connects to host 1 as well, host 1 knows the information of data ip and port of the connected ones to it, host 1 gives information out both host 2 , host 3's data and vice versa
so that the two hosts can connect using each other

(c) In the context of "port restricted" NAT devices, what does the hole-punching technique do? Describe this technique, using a diagram to aid your explanation if appropriate. 

Holde punching breaches the firewall by puncturing a hole through it that then allows a packet to be sent from an outside system.
